== Domain model

The petclinic application is organized around three core aggregate roots:

* _Owner_ - Manages pet ownership and contains Pet entities within its consistency boundary, serving as the entry point for all pet-related operations and information management.
* _Veterinarian_ - Represents medical practitioners and their specialties, maintaining practitioner credentials, areas of expertise, and professional information as an independent business entity.
* _Visit_ - Captures the business transactions between pets and veterinarians, encapsulating appointment scheduling, medical procedures, treatment records, and billing as a cohesive unit with its own lifecycle.
