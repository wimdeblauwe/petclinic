icon:calendar[] 2025-06-27

== Context

To have rapid development and a solid base to build upon, we will use an application framework.

We need:

* Ability to create a REST API
* Ability to interface with a database
* Ability to secure the application

Given the extensive expertise with the Spring framework and the support of the framework of all we need out-of-the-box, the choice is clear.

== Decision

We will use the https://spring.io/[Spring] framework.
