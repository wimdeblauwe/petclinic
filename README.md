# Petclinic sample project

This project is inspired by the [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/tree/main) example application.
It shows how I like to write production-ready Spring Boot applications.

The principles I use are explained in the following blog posts:

* [How I write production-ready Spring Boot applications](https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2025/06/24/how-i-write-production-ready-spring-boot-applications/)
* How I test production-ready Spring Boot applications.
